    <h2><strong>Our History</strong></h2>
    <p>Washington's Address Confidentiality Program (ACP) is designed to help people who fear for their safety maintain 
    a confidential address. Passed by legislature in 1991, ACP is used as part of an overall safety plan to prevent 
    perpetrators from locating participants through public records such as driver licenses, voter registries and marriage 
    records.</p>
    <p>Washington's ACP is available to state residents who are targets of stalking, domestic violence, trafficking or 
    sexual assault. In 2011, the program expanded to include criminal justice employees who have been threatened or harassed 
    because of their work. Currently, the ACP serves more than 5,000 residents.</p>
    <p>Washington's ACP was the first program of its kind in the nation. Today some 40 states and territories have established similar programs.</p>

    <h2><strong>What We Do</strong></h2>
    <p>When someone enrolls in the ACP, they are assigned a P.O. Box address that they can use as their legal home, work or school 
    address.  State, county and city government agencies are legally required to accept the substitute address.</p>
    <p>The ACP accepts all First Class, registered, certified and election mail on behalf of participants, then forwards mail to the 
    participants actual address. </p>
    <p>The  program also provides confidentiality for two normally public records: voter registration and marriage records. ACP 
    participants may register to vote as Protected Records Voters (PRV's) and apply for Protected Records Marriage (PRM) licensing, 
    which means no record is made available to the public. If the participant uses the program correctly, the participantsâ€™ actual 
    physical address may remain out of public records and unavailable to their perpetrator(s).</p>
    <h3><strong>Limitations</strong></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Federal government and private businesses are not required to accept the ACP address.</li>
      <li>ACP cannot redact already public personal information</li>
      <li>Actual residential address may still be required to: purchase a home, apply for a line of credit, set up utilities, purchase a firearm, etc.</li>
    </ul>
